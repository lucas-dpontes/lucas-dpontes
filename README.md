# Lucas Pontes
I work in operations intelligence, an area that is also known as data analysis, process analysis or business analysis. I can transformin raw data into information that can be used for strategic decision making in companies!

I have more than 3 years of experience in the Operations and Process area. I worked with SQL, Azure DevOps, Power BI, Dashboards and statistics to supoprt the implementation of systems and projects. I also have knowledge of Python, and add other programming languages as needed for data analysis.

I have a degree in Operations Engineering and Science and Technology, both from the Federal University of ABC, and I also did an cultural exchange in Canada in 2014.

I just concluded a 400-hour Data Analytics bootcamp in Le Wagon Programming School, to improve my knowledge in Data Analysis.

I am available to exchange information, experiences in these areas or have a coffee, at these contacts:
