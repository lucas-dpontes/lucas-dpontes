# Lucas Pontes
🚀 I work in operations intelligence, an area that is also known as data analysis, process analysis or business analysis. I can transformin raw data into information that can be used for strategic decision making in companies!

📊 I have more than 3 years of experience in the Operations and Process area. I worked with SQL, Azure DevOps, Power BI, Dashboards and statistics to support the implementation of systems and projects. I also have knowledge of Python, and add other programming languages as needed for data analysis.

🎓 I have a degree in Operations Engineering and Science and Technology, both from the Federal University of ABC, and I also did an cultural exchange in Canada in 2014.

📈 I recently finished a 400-hour Data Analytics bootcamp in Le Wagon school, to improve my knowledge in Data Analysis, and I am studying Data Science at EBAC (the British School of Creative Arts & Technology).
